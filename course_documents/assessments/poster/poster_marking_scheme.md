# CP 2024 Poster Marking Scheme

This assessment is band marked, which means you won't get a numerical mark, but instead a band - similar to a dissertation.  When marking, we will consider the following:


## Poster: 
- Content (weighted 70%): 
    - Introduction and relationship to wider field
        - Is the choice of paper motivated, is the problem considered well-introduced and clear? 
        - Is it clear that the student understands the approaches used?
    	- Does the poster give context and show understanding of the field?
	- Is the importance of the paper clear?  Is it clear how this paper relates to others?
    - Results discussion
    	- Does the student clearly understand the results and their implications?
    - Discussion of limitations
    	- Are the limitations of the paper, both in the work itself and in the context of the field clear? 
	- Is it clear that the student has reflected critically on the contribution of the paper?
    - Concluding thoughts
    	- Has the student summarised the most important aspects of the paper?
	- Is it clear that the student understands why these are important, and has made suitable choices on what to emphasise?
- Presentation (weighted 20%):
- when grading take into account:
    - Layout
    - Readability
    - Language (grammar, etc)


## Question-answer on poster day (weighted 10%):
- when grading take into account:
    - did student understand question, clarify if needed?
    - is the answer logical and thoughtful?
    - if the student doesn't know the answer, they may conjecture thoughtfully so long as they make this clear.  
    - is the answer concise, fitting within a 2-minute window?
