Viva assessment

Band marked

Following your assignment 3 submission, you will join me and a GTA for a short viva (or other assessment if this is not suitable for you.)

I will be asking you questions related to your assignment 3 submission as well as the graph burning papers we have discussed in lecture, with an approximately equal weighting between these.  

Please bring with you:
- preferably a printed copy of your minizinc model and your ILP model, or failing this pre-loaded readable versions of these on a laptop or tablet
- any physical paper notes that you want to bring, including (e.g.) copies of the papers 
- your student card

FAQS: (send more on Teams, I will update!)
- Can you give an example of the types of questions you might ask?
  - I might ask, for example, about particular aspects of your models: what do particular variables represent or particular constriants do?  Given an incorrect burning sequence, what part of your models prevents that being considered correct?  If something does not work as intended, what and why?  Why did you chose the particular approaches you did?  Regarding the papers, how do the CSP and ILP models we discussed work, how do they differ, what are the advantages, etc?  What are the advantages and disadvantages of the appraoches taken in each paper?
- How are the answers marked?
  - We are ultimately looking for evidence of how well you have achieved the learning outcomes of this assessment and your understanding of the papers: that is, how much do you understand the models, the technologies, and their advantages and disatvantages.  If you are easily able to explain and it is clear you have deep understanding, this is likely an A, if you get everything correct and are reasonably concise and show understanding then this is likely a B, if you are incorrect in a small way or need a lot of follow-up or help to get toward the right answer but are still showing good understanding this is likely a C, if you are showing only some understanding or your answer has major weaknesses this is likely a D.
