CP and ILP via Graph Burning

We will be working through some advanced work on CP and ILP modelling using the graph burning problem as a central theme.  We will look at several papers on the topic, and compare different approaches looking at the development over time.  

Here are links to the papers that we will be looking at, with a brief description of what we discussed in each:

A survey on graph burning in general: https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10642 
- here we talked about the definition of the graph burning problem, and mentioned the graph burnign conjecture

CP and ILP formulations:
https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/10/15/2777
- here we looked in fair detail at each of the CSP/ILP models for graph burning, and discussed ow the worked, how the differed and where they are similar.
- we takked about the interaction with binary search
- we looked at the relative performances, and what the authors think about why these perform as they do

Parameterized complexity (this in less detail):
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.08811
- we talked briefly about what parameterised algorithms are, and why and when they help us
- we talked very briefly about why we would care about these algorithms

A greedy heuristic algorithm (less detail):
https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07577
- we talked about what a greedy algorithm is, what a heuristic algorithm is, and what they can and cannot do
- we talked abotu the differences (and advantages and disadvantages) of heurstic, parameterise, adn exact exponential algorithms
- we very briefly mentioned the link to approximation algorithms, and what an approximation algorithm is

An exact row-generation algorithm (integer programming): https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17080
- here we looked at the updated ILP approach, compared it briefly to the ones in the earlier paper
- we looked at the results here and talked about the comparison to other approaches
