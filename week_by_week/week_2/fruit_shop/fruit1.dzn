% now modify data and model such that 
% (a) we have minimum purchase of each item, i.e.
%     if you buy bananas you must buy at least 2
% (b) we have minimum and maximum customer demands for
%     each kind of fruit (possibly zero)
% (c) Turn this into a decision problem, "Can we make at least this much profit?"

% (d) Are all decision problems in (c) equally hard?
% (e) see homework h03
